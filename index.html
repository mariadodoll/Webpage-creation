    <p><center>Welcome to Cool Club</center></p>
    <P><Center>To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
       <BR>
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
          <BR>
            or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?<Center></P>
        
            <BR>
              <BR>
<P><Center>To die: to sleep; no more; 
  <BR>
  and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 
    <BR>
  'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd.<Center></P>
