    <p><center>Welcome to Cool Club</center></p>
    <P>To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
      or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? </P>
<P>To die: to sleep; no more; 
  and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 
  'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd.</P>
