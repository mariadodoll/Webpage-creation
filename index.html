    <p><center>Welcome to Cool Club</center></p>
    <P><Center>To be, or not to be: that is the question:<center> 
       <BR>
      <center>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<center>
          <BR>
           <center>or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?<Center></P>
        
            <BR>
              <BR>
<P><Center>To die: to sleep; no more;<center> 
  <BR>
  <center>and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to,<center> 
    <BR>
  <center>'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd.<Center></P>
